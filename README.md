 # HuesoTester
 
 HuesoTester is a short circuit and continuity tester in PCB's that are used as bridges in electronic door locks testing.

 As far the in-board connectors are tiny for testing in production line the technicians in production plant use those PCBs to make the conectors bigger, the problem become because the PCBs are developed manually and needs to be tested too.

 Hueso tester tests the PCBs bridges before and in production line (if the End-Of-Line test shows an error).
 
 Those PCB's are used in manufacturing production enviroments in Ensenada, Mexico.
